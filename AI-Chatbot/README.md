# Chatbot

### I have used the following tools and concepts for creating the chatbot in python:
* Numpy
* Tensorflow
* Nltk
* Neural Networks

### Ask me questions about the following:
* Greetings
* My name
* My age
* My schooling
* My career goals
* My skills
* My job interests

### Note: You will require tensorflow version <= 1.14 and python 3.6 to run the code:
* The commandline instructions for anaconda are as follows:
  * conda create -n tf tensorflow=1.14 python=3.6
  * conda activate tf
  * pip install tflearn
  * pip install nltk
  * pip install numpy
