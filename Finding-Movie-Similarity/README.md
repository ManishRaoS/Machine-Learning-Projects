## Finding Movie Simalrities
Both movies, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, are movies based on aliens coming to Earth. I've seen both, and they indeed share many similarities. It could be concluded that both of these fall into the same genre of movies based on intuition.Similarly in this notebook, I have quantified the similarity of movies based on their plot summaries available on IMDb and Wikipedia, then separated them into groups, also known as clusters. I have additionally created a dendrogram to represent how closely the movies are related to each other.
